# Cancer Atlas — Project Brief

## Vision
An interactive patient-education / research tool: a body → organ → cancer → mutation
drill-down, inspired by 3D anatomy explorers (e.g. a rotatable/zoomable heart model
with clickable "investigate" points). The person should be able to search or click
into a generic body, land on an organ, see what cancers affect it, pick one, and
drill all the way down to individual sampled cells and their mutation profiles.

**Audience:** patient education + research/teaching. Not a clinical or diagnostic tool.
**Non-goal:** this is not, and should never become, personalized medical advice or a
tool that implies it's showing one real patient's data.

## Current state (as of this handoff)
A single-file HTML prototype (`cancer-atlas.html`) built in Claude.ai using vanilla
JS + three.js (0.185.1, loaded as an ES module via an import map — see Architecture
notes; there is no global-script build anymore), no build step, no backend. It
proves out the full navigation pattern end-to-end for **one** organ/cancer pair:

- **Body screen** — stylized SVG female silhouette (not a real mesh), draggable/
  zoomable via CSS 3D transforms, with hotspot markers on ~6 organs. Search bar
  filters organs by name. Only **Ovaries** is wired; other organs show a "coming
  soon" toast + marker pulse when clicked, to demonstrate the intended pattern
  without needing content for every organ yet.
- **Organ screen (Ovary)** — a real WebGL 3D mesh (three.js), organic/lumpy
  ellipsoid built via deterministic vertex displacement (no external noise lib),
  drag-to-rotate + scroll-to-zoom via three's real `OrbitControls`, wrapped in
  the shared `makeViewer` helper (see Architecture notes). Four clickable
  "investigate" points (Surface epithelium, Cortex, Medulla, Hilum) raycast on
  click and populate an info card below the model. Below that: real anatomical
  facts, then a list of the 5 real ovarian carcinoma subtypes with real
  prevalence figures — only HGSOC is wired, others show "profile coming soon."
- **Cancer screen (HGSOC)** — three.js scene: four organic blob meshes, one per
  real anatomical spread site (see Data rules below), same `makeViewer` pattern,
  click a blob → drills into that site's ~22 sampled cells (flat 2D scatter,
  intentionally *not* 3D — this level represents a pathology-slide view, not a
  spatial location). Click a cell → side panel with a full mutation ledger.
- **Breadcrumb** at the top reflects the full chain (Body › Ovary › HGSOC ›
  [site] › [cell]) and is clickable at every level.
- **Keyboard accessibility is wired end-to-end** (commit `c5acece`) and must be
  preserved when adding organs: inactive screens/layers get `inert` (screens are
  hidden via `opacity`/`pointer-events`, never `display:none`), every clickable
  div goes through `makeActivatable` for button semantics, and 3D hotspots that
  have no DOM node of their own get projected DOM proxies repositioned each
  frame from the camera (`.organ-point` / `.site-label` — the label divs *are*
  the focusable buttons; the mouse path stays the WebGL raycast). Container
  roles matter: keep `role="group"` on viewer wrappers (canvas takes
  `role="img"`), or the projected buttons vanish from the accessibility tree.

## Data rules (do not relax these)
1. **Every organ/cancer pair needs its own real-data pass.** Genes, mutation
   frequencies, and any "spread pattern" or clonal architecture claims must come
   from actual published sources (TCGA, named peer-reviewed studies, etc.), not
   invented for flavor. It's fine to *simplify* granularity (e.g. simulating
   per-cell assignment when true single-cell spatial data isn't public) but it
   is not fine to invent gene names, frequencies, or studies.
2. **Say what's real and what's illustrative, explicitly, in-product.** The
   existing disclaimer pattern (small text, bottom-right, cites the actual
   studies by name/year) should be replicated for every new organ/cancer added.
3. **Mutation model vocabulary** (established and should stay consistent):
   - **Trunk** — present in ~all tumor cells; the founding/earliest driver event.
   - **Branch** — arose within one anatomical site/subclone, not all of them.
   - **Private** — unique to one sampled cell; illustrates ongoing heterogeneity.
   - **Driver** vs **Passenger** badge on every mutation.
   - Each mutation entry needs: gene/event name, class (driver/passenger),
     a frequency or CCF figure where one exists, and a one-line plain-language
     "why this matters" note (no jargon dump).
4. Ovary/HGSOC reference sources already used, for continuity:
   - TCGA, *Nature*, 2011 (integrated genomic analysis of ovarian carcinoma —
     TP53 ~96%, recurrent CDK12/NF1/RB1 alterations, CCNE1 amplification).
   - McPherson et al., *Nature Genetics*, 2016 (multi-site whole-genome
     sequencing of HGSOC — ovary → omentum → peritoneum → bowel spread pattern,
     BRCA1/2 pathway loss and HR-deficiency framing).
   - Real ovarian carcinoma subtype shares: HGSOC ~70%, endometrioid ~10%,
     clear-cell ~10%, mucinous ~3%, low-grade serous <5%.

## Design system
- **Palette:** deep navy background (`#0b0f1a`, radial gradient toward
  `#101a30`), panels `#121a2b` / `#0e1524`, hairline borders `#24314a`.
  Accent teal `#35c9c1` (structural/UI accent, investigate-point glow). Clone/
  site colors: coral `#ff6b5e`, azure `#4f8dfd`, amber `#f2b642`, violet
  `#a78bfa`. Driver = coral, passenger = muted slate `#6b7c99`.
- **Type:** Space Grotesk (display/headings), IBM Plex Sans (body), IBM Plex
  Mono (data, badges, breadcrumb separators, mutation gene names). Loaded via
  Google Fonts.
- **Tone:** clinical-but-warm "specimen viewer" aesthetic — glowing points,
  soft depth, restrained motion. Avoid generic dark-mode-neon or cream/serif
  clichés.
- **Interaction pattern, keep consistent across every new organ/cancer:**
  drag = rotate, scroll/wheel = zoom, click a glowing/colored point = drill in
  or open an info card, breadcrumb always reflects current depth and is always
  clickable back up the chain.

## Architecture notes
- **Screen state machine:** top-level `screen` = `body | organ | cancer`.
  Within `cancer`, `txLevel` = `1` (site map) `| 2` (cell scatter) `| 3` (panel
  open). `renderCrumbs()` derives the full breadcrumb from both.
- **three.js loading (migrated 2026-08-23; r128 global script → 0.185.1 ESM):**
  three ships ESM-only now, loaded via an import map with two entries — `three`
  and `three/addons/`. **The addons entry is mandatory, not decorative:**
  `examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js` imports bare `'three'` internally, so
  removing it breaks every addon import. Module scripts are CORS-fetched, which
  means `file://` no longer works at all — serve over HTTP.
- **Rendering defaults were neutralized, not adopted.** Four r128→r185 default
  changes would silently alter the hand-tuned look, and each is pinned back in
  code: `THREE.ColorManagement.enabled = false`; explicit
  `renderer.outputColorSpace = LinearSRGBColorSpace`; explicit `decay: 1` on
  point/spot lights (default flipped to 2 in r146); and every light intensity
  multiplied by `LEGACY_LIGHT_SCALE = Math.PI` (r155 deleted `useLegacyLights`,
  which costs a factor of π). Do not "clean up" these opt-outs in passing —
  adopting the color-correct pipeline and re-tuning all five lights to match is
  an **open, deliberately deferred design decision**, not an oversight.
- **3D viewer helper:** `makeViewer(container, opts)` wraps three's real
  `OrbitControls` (drag-to-rotate, wheel-to-zoom, idle auto-rotate) plus the
  scene/renderer/framing plumbing. Both the ovary viewer and the tumor site-map
  viewer are built on it — **reuse this** for new organs.
- **Click-vs-drag disambiguation stays app-side, by necessity.** `OrbitControls`
  has no built-in "was this a click or a drag" concept, and its `change` event
  cannot substitute: `update()` fires `change` on every auto-rotate frame
  regardless of user input. The 6px pointer-movement threshold lives in
  `makeMoveTracker` (shared with the body screen, so the threshold is defined
  once) — don't go looking for an OrbitControls replacement; it was confirmed
  not to exist.
- **Zoom-speed calibration must anchor to the camera's actual framed distance,
  not a nominal radius.** `applyFraming()` slides the camera out to fit the
  meshes — for the site map that lands near 2× the configured radius — so
  `calibrateZoomSpeed(radius)` is re-run at the end of `applyFraming()` with
  the real distance. Anchoring to `opts.radius` was a real shipped bug (site
  viewer zoomed 1.8× too fast while the ovary viewer, whose framed distance
  happens to sit near its nominal, masked it). Any new viewer gets this for
  free through `makeViewer`; don't bypass it.
- **Organic mesh look:** `organicDisplace(geometry, amplitude, freq, seed)` —
  deterministic sine-based vertex displacement, no noise library dependency.
  Reuse for any new organ/tumor mesh; vary `seed`/`freq`/`amplitude` per organ
  for visual variety.
- Renderers are sized off `container.clientWidth/clientHeight`; screens use
  `opacity`/`pointer-events` toggling rather than `display:none`, so containers
  have valid dimensions even while "hidden" — call `.resize()` on screen
  transitions defensively anyway (see `setScreen()`).

## Known limitations / tech debt
- Body silhouette is a stylized SVG mannequin, not a real 3D mesh or medical
  model — fine for proving navigation, not for a polished v1.
- Tumor-site blob positions are schematic, not anatomically precise.
- Single HTML file with vanilla JS closures — will not scale cleanly past a
  handful of organs. Needs modularizing (one data module per organ/cancer,
  a shared viewer component, some kind of build step) before adding much more
  content.
- No backend/data layer yet — everything is a hardcoded JS object per organ.
  Worth deciding early whether additional organs stay static JSON/JS or move
  to something queryable, especially if this grows past ~5-6 organs.

## Suggested next steps (priority order)
1. Decide on and set up real project structure (framework choice, file
   layout, whether to keep the no-build-step constraint or introduce one).
2. Extract the reusable pieces (`makeViewer`, `organicDisplace`, mutation
   panel component, breadcrumb component) into shared modules.
3. Pick the next organ/cancer pair and repeat the real-data-sourcing process
   documented above before writing any code for it.
4. Revisit the body screen — decide if a stylized silhouette is the permanent
   direction or a placeholder for a proper 3D body mesh later.

The current working prototype is `cancer-atlas.html` — read it in full before
making changes; it's the single source of truth for what's built so far.
